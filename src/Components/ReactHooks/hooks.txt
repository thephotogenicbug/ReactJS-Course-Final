1. Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other
   React features without writing a class
   
   Hooks solves the problem of code reuse across components. they are
   written without classes. This does not mean that React is getting rid
   of classes, but hooks is just an alternate approach.

   2. React applications are formed by composing different components
      There are 2 types of component

   .Stateful components(Class Components)
   .Stateless components(Function Components) we cannot manage state inside functional component
   but using hooks we can manage the state in function based component

   State is only available in class component because a class component
   extends Component class from React which makes the React's State available 
   to the component
